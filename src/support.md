# Support（技术支持）

This document contains some hints to get you started, but it is not a comprehensive guide. To actually write an add-on, you will need to familiarize yourself with Anki’s source code, and the source code of other add-ons that do similiar things to what you are trying to accomplish.
本文档提供了一些入门指引，而不是全面的指南。要真正开始编写插件，你需要熟悉 Anki 的源代码，以及其他功能相近的插件的源代码。

Because of our limited resources, no official support is available for add-on writing. If you have any questions, you will either need to find the answers yourself in the source code, or post your questions on the development forum.
由于资源有限，我们**不为插件编写提供官方技术支持**。如果你有任何问题，需要自行在源代码中寻找答案，或将问题发布在[开发者论坛](https://forums.ankiweb.net/c/development/12)上。

You can also use the add-on forum to request someone write an add-on for you. You may need to offer some money before anyone becomes interested in helping you.
你也可以在插件论坛上发帖，请求他人为你编写插件。提供一些报酬，或许会有人愿意提供帮助。
